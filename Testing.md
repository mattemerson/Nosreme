WhiteBox Testing
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-box_testing
White-box testing (also known as clear box testing, glass box testing, transparent box testing, and structural testing) is a method of testing software that tests internal structures or workings of an application, as opposed to its functionality (i.e. black-box testing)

Black Box Testing
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-box_testing
a method of software testing that examines the functionality of an application without peering into its internal structures or workings. This method of test can be applied virtually to every level of software testing: unit, integration, system and acceptance. It is sometimes referred to as specification-based testing.

Test Driven Development
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development
A software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: Requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only. This is opposed to software development that allows software to be added that is not proven to meet requirements
